iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following pages were written, at the request of the
Incumbent of Battlefield, with the object of giving to the
numerous visitors to Battlefield Church some historical and
descriptive notices of that venerable fabric, together with a
brief account of the Battle of Shrewsbury, and of the foundation
of the College.&nbsp; They are reprinted, with a few corrections
and additions, from <i>Eddowes&rsquo;s Shrewsbury Journal</i>, in
which they first appeared.</p>
<p>The writer has consulted Owen and Blakeway, Dugdale, Dukes,
Brookes, and other well-known authorities; but ventures to think
that some hitherto unknown facts, which have been brought to
light through researches at the Public Record Office and Public
Libraries, will be found here given for the first time.&nbsp; He
has in view a History, on a larger scale, of this most
interesting College and Church, and will be grateful for any
additional documents or items of information relating
thereto.</p>

1</span><i>BATTLEFIELD CHURCH</i>, <i>SALOP</i>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">By the Rev. Wm.
Geo. Dimock Fletcher</span>, M.A.<br />
F.S.A., <span class="smcap">Vicar of St. Michael&rsquo;s</span>,
<span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span>.</p>
<p>Battlefield Church owes its foundation to the success achieved
by King Henry IV. at the battle of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; That prince,
who as Duke of Hereford had been banished in 1398 for ten years
by Richard II., returned to England in the following year, on the
death of his father, John of Gaunt ostensibly to claim his
estates which the King had seized.&nbsp; He was joined by the
Percies, Nevills, and other barons, and marched towards the west
of England.&nbsp; Bristol having been captured, and the King
shortly afterwards made prisoner, Henry avowed his design of
seizing the crown, the Duke of York supporting him.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the King was compelled to sign a deed of
renunciation to the crown, and a parliament was summoned to meet
at Westminster 30 Sept. 1399, at which Richard&rsquo;s cession
was read and approved, and the sentence of deposition solemnly
passed, and the estates of the realm forthwith consented that
Henry should reign over them.&nbsp; Although Henry&rsquo;s claim
to the throne was ridiculous, as opposed to that of Edmund <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Mortimer, Earl
of March, who was not only great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp,
but his father Roger Mortimer had been as far back as 1385
declared by the King presumptive heir to the throne, still this
revolution and elevation of Henry IV. to the throne was a
national act, and the Lancastrian Kings must not therefore be
considered as usurpers.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Shrewsbury, and
of the county of Salop generally, assented to Henry&rsquo;s
accession &ldquo;most joyfully, with their most entire will and
heart,&rdquo; as their own words, preserved on the Rolls of
Parliament, show.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Battle of Shrewsbury</span>.</h2>
<p>The Percies, we have seen, strongly supported Henry IV. on his
first landing in England, and cordially assisted him in the
events which led to his becoming king.&nbsp; Their friendship,
however, was not of long duration.&nbsp; A variety of causes led
to the formidable rebellion, which culminated in the battle of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In July, 1402, the Scots invaded England, but
were defeated by Henry Percy (called &ldquo;Hotspur&rdquo;), at
Homildon Hill, on September 14th, and the Earl of Douglas and
other nobles were taken.&nbsp; King Henry issued a writ eight
days later, forbidding the Earl of Northumberland to dispose of
his prisoners; and this was one cause of offence.&nbsp; They may
too have been offended at Henry&rsquo;s refusal to allow them to
treat for the liberation of their kinsman, Sir Edmund Mortimer,
uncle to the young Earl of March, from the hands of Owen Glyndwr;
and they may have relented at the part they had acted against
King Richard.&nbsp; Probably meaner motives actuated them, for
King Henry left them to conduct the Welsh and Scottish wars on
their own resources, and Henry Percy complains in a letter <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>dated 26th
June, 1403, remaining among the Privy Council Records, that
&ldquo;&pound;20,000 and more&rdquo; was owing to himself and his
father on that account; their claim was left unpaid.&nbsp; The
winter of 1402 was spent by the Percies in strengthening their
party.&nbsp; They entered into a treaty with Owen Glyndwr, the
Welsh chieftain, who, with remarkable success, had taken up arms
against the English, and had repelled three formidable armies led
by the king in person, for the overthrow of Henry IV.&nbsp;
Historians have usually treated this insurrection as having been
set on foot to dethrone King Henry, and to restore Richard II. if
alive, or if dead to place Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, upon
the throne of England.</p>
<p>The Earl of Northumberland was ill, and remained at Berwick;
but his son, Henry Percy (Hotspur), with the Earl of Douglas and
a great army, early in July, 1403, set out on his long march for
Shrewsbury, where he had arranged to meet Glyndwr.&nbsp; He
passed through Cheshire, where his army was reinforced by a
number of the gentlemen of that county, who had always been
attached to the memory of Richard II., and came to Stafford,
where his uncle, the Earl of Worcester, joined him.</p>
<p>Percy&rsquo;s army probably marched from Stafford, and entered
Shropshire on its eastern side, passing through Newport by High
Ercall and Haughmond Hill, and so arrived at Shrewsbury some time
on the evening of the 19th July.&nbsp; They marched down the
Castle Foregate, but finding that the king had only a few hours
before entered the town, and seeing the royal standard floating
over the Castle, Percy withdrew his forces to the Bull-field, an
extensive common, which stretched from Upper Berwick to the
east.</p>
<p>King Henry was at Burton-on-Trent, with an army which he had
assembled against the Welsh, <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>when he heard of the
confederates&rsquo; hostile movements, and immediately marched
towards Shrewsbury.&nbsp; On the 17th he was at Lichfield, and
taking the Watling St. Road, he probably entered the town on the
19th over the English Bridge.&nbsp; By this course he secured the
passage of the Severn, and prevented Owen Glyndwr, who had
advanced with his forces to Oswestry, from crossing the river and
effecting a junction with Percy.</p>
<p>Percy is said to have slept on the evening of the 19th at the
mansion of the Bettons at Upper Berwick, on the site where Mr.
Edgerley&rsquo;s residence now stands.&nbsp; Tradition says that
he cut the outline of his hand on a panel with a pen-knife, and a
wise woman prophesied that the Bettons should retain their estate
so long as they kept the panel.&nbsp; The Bettons are said to
have lost the panel in the present century, and they have parted
with their estate also.</p>
<p>As the king had nothing to gain by delay, it was clearly his
interest to fight before Glyndwr could bring up his forces, and
especially as his army was superior in numbers to
Percy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And so it seems probable that, early on the
morning of the 20th July, he sent a body of troops, under the
nominal command of Prince Henry, then 14 years old, to come up
with Percy at Upper Berwick, if possible; whilst he himself with
the main body marched along Castle Foregate and the Hadnall Road,
ready to proceed, either towards Upper Berwick and so hem Percy
in between his two divisions, or to intercept his retreat should
he attempt to march to the east.&nbsp; Percy broke up in some
disorder, and marched by Harlescot and Albright Hussey to
Hateley-field, probably with the intention of retreating through
Hodnet and Market Drayton northwards, but <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>finding a
retreat impracticable in the face of a superior force, no course
remained for him but to turn at bay and fight.</p>
<p>Percy accordingly marshalled his forces, posting a portion of
them behind a field of peas, in order to afford some obstacle to
the royal attack.&nbsp; They were chiefly stationed on the north
side of the present Church, in a field called the Hateleys.&nbsp;
Tradition says that Percy called for his favourite sword, but
being told that it was left behind at Berwick, of which village
he had not till then learned the name, he turned pale and
exclaimed, &ldquo;I perceive that my plough is drawing to its
last furrow, for a wizard told me in Northumberland that I should
perish at Berwick, which I vainly interpreted of that town in the
north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s forces were divided into two columns, of
which he commanded one in person, and entrusted the other to his
son.&nbsp; The field on the east of the church is called the
King&rsquo;s Croft, and here perhaps were ranged the troops which
the king himself commanded.</p>
<p>When the armies were drawn up, facing each other, waiting for
the signal to begin, the Abbot of Shrewsbury left the royal army
and came to Percy, in the hope of effecting peace between the two
parties.&nbsp; On behalf of the king he offered pardon to Percy
and his adherents, if they would lay down their arms, and a
redress of grievances.&nbsp; The stern temper of the Earl of
Worcester however rejected all attempts at conciliation; and both
sides flew to arms.&nbsp; The two armies were not equal in
numbers.&nbsp; Percy had 14,000 men, including a large force of
Cheshire archers.&nbsp; The royal array was probably nearly
double that number; for 40,000 men are said to have been engaged
in the battle.</p>
<p>The battle commenced by a fierce discharge of <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>arrows on both
sides, and raged with violence.&nbsp; Percy, with the Earl of
Douglas and some thirty others, in the heat of the battle, bent
on the king&rsquo;s destruction, valiantly forced their way into
the centre of his forces.&nbsp; At one period Henry&rsquo;s van
was broken, his standard overthrown; his son Prince Henry was
wounded in the face by an arrow; Edmund, Earl of Stafford, Sir
Walter Blount, and three other persons armed like the king, were
slain; and the king himself was unhorsed, and likely to be slain,
had he not been withdrawn from danger by Dunbar, the Scottish
Earl of March.&nbsp; At an important moment, Henry brought up his
reserve, which seems to have turned the scale; and Percy himself
was killed by an unknown hand, either by a spear, or by an arrow
which pierced his brain, alone, and surrounded by his foes.&nbsp;
The king at once took advantage of this, and shouted aloud,
&ldquo;Henry Percy is dead;&rdquo; and the insurgent forces gave
way and fled in every direction.&nbsp; The battle had lasted
three hours.</p>
<p>On Henry&rsquo;s side, 3,000 are said to have been wounded,
and about 1,600 slain, including Edmund Earl of Stafford, Sir
Hugh Stanley, Sir John Clifton, Sir John Cokaine, Sir Nicholas
Gausel, Sir Walter Blount, Sir John Calverley, Sir John Massey,
of Puddington, Sir Hugh Mortimer, Sir Richard Sandford, and Sir
Robert Gausel.&nbsp; On Percy&rsquo;s side the loss of those
slain in the battle or pursuit has been estimated at 5,000,
including Sir John Massey, of Tatton, and 200 knights and
gentlemen of Cheshire.&nbsp; The Earl of Worcester, Sir Richard
Venables, and Sir Richard Vernon, were taken prisoners, and
beheaded on the 21st at the High Cross at Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
Worcester&rsquo;s head was set up over London Bridge; his
headless body is conjectured to have been buried in the <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Leyburnes&rsquo; tomb in the chapel of the Holy Trinity
in St. Mary&rsquo;s Salop.&nbsp; Percy&rsquo;s body was at first
decently interred by his kinsman Lord Furnival; but was
afterwards taken up, and placed for public exhibition between two
millstones near the pillory in Shrewsbury, and then beheaded and
quartered, and portions sent to several towns in England.</p>
<p>The dead were buried in a large trench or pit made on the
field of battle, near the spot where the church was afterwards
built.&nbsp; Many years ago, when a drain was made to carry off
the wet from the Corbet vault in the small close lying on the
north side of the chancel, the workmen cut through large masses
of human bones.&nbsp; Many others, some in leaden coffins, were
found lying underneath the flooring of the church, when it was
being restored, about 1860.&nbsp; No doubt numbers of the slain
were interred in other fields and meadows in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Many persons of note, who perished in the
battle, were interred at the Augustine Friars and Friar-preachers
in Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>A few fragments of armour, spurs, and other relics, have been
from time to time dug up on the site of the field of battle, but
in comparatively small quantities.&nbsp; At Sundorne Castle are
preserved two helmets and several cuirasses, swords, pikes,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. Pountney Smith possesses a cast-iron
cannon-ball, about three inches in diameter, and weighing nearly
4lbs; and another gentleman residing in Shrewsbury has a
sword.&nbsp; Grose in his <i>Military Antiquities</i> gives an
engraving of a bill, or more probably a gisarme.&nbsp; Two
shields were ploughed up in the year 1823.</p>
<p>In the field on the south side of the church are a number of
mounds and ditches.&nbsp; Are these earthworks connected with the
field of battle, or <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>are they foundations of the college buildings, or mounds
for the burial of those slain in the battle, or are they merely
old gravel-pits?&nbsp; The matter is worth investigation.</p>
<p>Owen Glyndwr is said to have been unable to ford the Severn
and join Percy, owing to the waters being swollen.&nbsp;
Tradition makes him to have ascended the branches of a lofty oak
at Shelton, whose venerable trunk still remains, and there to
have waited the issue of the battle.&nbsp; Another account states
that he was at the time besieging Caermarthen, and was not near
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The battle of Shrewsbury was one of the decisive battles in
the history of England.&nbsp; Had Percy been successful, and the
King defeated, the Lancastrian dynasty would probably not have
occupied the throne of England.&nbsp; What turn the course of
events would then have taken, it is impossible even to
conjecture.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s victory established the
Lancastrian dynasty on the throne for nearly 60 years.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Foundation of the Church and
Chantry</span>.</h2>
<p>The battle of Shrewsbury was fought on the vigil or eve of St.
Mary Magdalene, Saturday, 21st July, 1403; and the place where it
was fought has ever since been called Battlefield.&nbsp; In
gratitude for, and in commemoration of this victory, the present
church of Battlefield was erected, and dedicated to St. Mary
Magdalene, and a college of secular canons was formed to serve
it.&nbsp; Its erection has often been ascribed to Henry IV., but
the real founder of the church was Roger Ive, priest, of Leaton,
rector of Fitz in 1399, and of Albright Hussey from 1398 to 1447,
and a staunch Lancastrian.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The site on which the church was built was <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>given by
Richard Hussey, Esq., of Albrighton Hussey, who on the 28th
October, 1406, obtained license from King Henry to assign to
Roger Yve and John Gilberd, chaplains, in frankalmoign, two acres
of land in Albrighton Hussey, lying in a certain field called
Hayteleyfeld, in which a battle was fought between the king and
Henry Percy, lately his adversary deceased, to celebrate divine
service daily in a certain chapel there, to be by them newly
built, for the king&rsquo;s salvation during his life, and after
his death for his soul, and for the souls of his progenitors and
of those who were slain in the battle and were there buried, and
for the souls of all the faithful departed.</p>
<p>The church was accordingly at once begun, and it seems to have
been completed, at least sufficiently for divine service to be
performed, in March, 1408&ndash;9, when the king, by letters
patent, founded and established the church into a perpetual
chantry of eight chaplains, one of whom was to be master; the
said master and chaplains to be capable of acquiring lands; and
he further endowed the Chantry with the advowson of the church of
Michaellskirke, in Lancashire.&nbsp; In August, 1409, the
receiver of Tutbury was commanded to deliver a quantity of lead
to cover the new chapel.&nbsp; Before February, 1409&ndash;10,
Roger Ive surrendered the land and chapel into the hands of the
king; from whom in March or May, 1410, he received a new and
fuller grant of the same, in which the said piece of land is
described as being enclosed by a ditch, and containing in length
and breadth two acres, together with two inlets and outlets, one
extending in length from Hadenallestone directly upon land of
Richard Hussey and the said piece of land, and containing in
breadth 20 feet, and the other in length from Harlascotelone
directly upon land of the said Richard, and containing in breadth
20 <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>feet.&nbsp; The king established the chapel of St. Mary
Magdalene into a perpetual Chantry of six chaplains, of which
Roger Ive and his successors, rectors of the chapel of St. John
Baptist at Albright Hussey, were to be masters, and Richard
Hussey and his heirs patrons.&nbsp; He endowed it with the
advowsons of Michaellskirke in Lancashire, St. Andrew of Iddesale
(or Shiffnall), and the free royal chapel of St. Michael within
the Castle Salop, to which the chapel of St. Juliana of Salop was
appurtenant or appendent.&nbsp; And he granted to Ive freedom
from tenths, fifteenths, subsidies, &amp;c.; and that he and his
successors should have a fair at the Chantry each year on the
feast of St. Mary Magdalene.&nbsp; John Repynton had been warden
of St. Michael&rsquo;s with St. Julian&rsquo;s, but resigned
these into the hands of King Henry V., in May 1417.</p>
<p>The above Charter of 27th March (or May) 1410, was practically
the Foundation Charter of the Chantry, and it was confirmed by
Henry V. on the 17th June, 1414, by Henry VI. on the 17th
November, 1425, and by Henry VII. on the 29th June, 1485.&nbsp;
Ive himself received a general pardon from Henry VI. in October
1424; and in December 1445 had license for himself and his
co-chaplains quietly to celebrate divine service without fear of
arrests, fines, amerciaments, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Roger Ive&rsquo;s will, which is dated 13th October, 1444,
contains the regulations and ordinances for the chantry or
college.&nbsp; By it, he directs his body to be buried in a stone
tomb near the high altar.&nbsp; He bequeaths to the five
chaplains three chalices, a paxbrede, two cruets, three brass
bells hanging in the belfry, three crosses, and a number of books
and vestments.&nbsp; The chaplains were to dwell in the mansion
already built there, and were to dine and sup together, and not
in their own rooms.&nbsp; They were not to leave the college <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>by night or
by day without the master&rsquo;s leave, under a penalty of 3s.
4d.&nbsp; They were each to swear and perform obedience to their
master, and were to receive a stipend of eight marcs a year
apiece, and two more for praying at every mass for the testator,
and keeping his obit annually.&nbsp; They were to pray for the
souls of Henry IV. and V., founders of the college, of Richard
Hussey, senior, the first patron, and Isolda, his wife, of John
Hussey, Richard Hussey the father of Richard Hussey then living,
and Thomas Hussey, of Roger Ive, the first master and his
parents, of William Howyke of Pountfret and Sir Thomas Kyrkeby,
chaplains, and for the souls of all the faithful departed slain
in the field of Battlefield, and there buried.&nbsp; Minute
directions are given as to the services to be performed.&nbsp;
The alms from indulgences granted to the college were to be
expended about the building and work of the belfry, and when this
was finished, then for the sustentation of the poor in the
college, and repair of their alms house.&nbsp; Besides the
advowsons before mentioned, he leaves them the profits of the
Chapel of Dadele (Dawley), the town and grange of Aston, and the
Chapel of Forde.</p>
<p>We have not much information extant about the college during
the 150 years of its existence.</p>
<p>In 1445, Roger Ive seems to have prosecuted before the barons
of the exchequer a claim to exemption from taxation in respect of
all the benefices belonging to the college.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Hereford certified that Ford was an appurtenance of St. Juliana,
Salop.&nbsp; The parishioners of Ford seem to have complained
that the college neglected to provide for divine service there;
and the Lord Chancellor wrote a letter between 1440 and 1443 to
the Bishop of Lichfield about this <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>neglect, and desiring him to remedy
it, which is preserved in the Bishop&rsquo;s Registers at
Lichfield.</p>
<p>A few years later the college claimed all the tithes of
Derfald, which they alleged belonged to them as possessors of St.
Michael&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Long before, however, in Henry II.&rsquo;s
reign, Haghmond Abbey had purchased a portion of Derfald.&nbsp;
Accordingly an agreement was come to in 1462 between Haghmond
Abbey and the college, by which the Abbey was to receive the
tithes of the grange and of all lands etc. of Derfald, between
the great close of Cowlande, and the great slade jointly to the
wood of Pimbeley, called Darrerisden.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Dissolution of the College</span>.</h2>
<p>The College or Chantry of Battlefield continued for nearly 150
years, and divine service was no doubt duly celebrated by the
chaplains, as directed by the foundation charter, and the will of
the first master.</p>
<p>In 1534 an Act was passed, which gave the first-fruits and
tenths to the king; and the Master of the College duly made a
return of the annual value of the property belonging to the
college, which consisted of lands in Aston near Shiffnal, and the
tithes of St. Michael de Wyre, Idsall, Dawley, St. Julian Salop,
Ford, and Albright Hussey, besides certain offerings, the total
annual value then being &pound;56 1s. 4d.&nbsp; Payments to the
ministers of St. Julian and Idsall, and procurations, &amp;c.
came to &pound;1 19s. 6d.&nbsp; The balance, amounting to
&pound;54 1s. 10d., being divisible amongst the master and
chaplains, the master receiving &pound;34 1s. 10d. and the five
chaplains &pound;4 apiece.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s tenth came to
&pound;5 8s. 2&frac14;d.</p>
<p>In 1545 all chapels and chantries were given to the
King.&nbsp; The possessions of the college were declared to be of
the yearly value of &pound;8 <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>15s., and the house unlet was valued
at 10s. a year.&nbsp; There were 12 oz. of plate, and some other
goods.&nbsp; The Church was stated not to be a parish church, but
to be within the parish of Albrighton Hussey.&nbsp; On Edward
VI.&rsquo;s accession to the Throne, the Lands belonging to the
chantries were given to the Crown.&nbsp; The certificate then
made by Sir Geo. Blount, Knt., states the net revenues to be of
the value of &pound;44 8s. 8d., of which the master received
&pound;19 6s., and 4 chaplains &pound;5 6s. 8d. apiece, and the
goods to be worth 13s. 4d.</p>
<p>The college was then dissolved, and the property sold to
various purchasers.&nbsp; The site of the college, and cottages
or booths near erected for the market there, the chapel and
tithes of Albright Hussey, the tithes of Harlescot, and the
Rectory of St. Julian&rsquo;s were sold to John Cupper and
Richard Trevor in 1550; land at St. Michael on Wyre to John
Pykarell and John Barnard, and to Richard Palladye; and Aston
near Shiffnal to Tho. Sydney and Nicholas Halswell.</p>
<p>The College is thus described in the <i>Particulars for
Grants</i> made <i>temp.</i> Edward VI.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mansion or site of the said late
College, with all houses edifices one dovecote one garden and two
orchards within the said site and precinct, late in the tenure of
the master and combrethren of the same late College; besides 2s.
4d. from the rent of a chamber called the Curates Lodging
assigned and reserved to the procurator there, now in the tenure
of Edward Shorde curate, valued and assessed by the Commissioner
of our Lord the King there at 17s. 8d. per annum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain Cottages or lez Bothes built upon land of
Richard Hussey near the site of the said late College, placed
there only in market time, with the outgoings tolls and other
profits arising annually in the time of a market held there on
the Feast of the <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Blessed Mary Magdalene, worth per annum 21s.
4d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same was given for certain yearly obits to be kept
with the said late College.&nbsp; There be no woods upon any the
premises.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commissioners left Edward Shorde, one of the chaplains, to
serve the church, with a chamber or lodging; and the following
goods to carry on the services, a return of which was made in
August, 1553,&mdash;3 bells, 2 great and a sanctus bell, 2
vestments, 2 altar cloths, a chalice with a paten parcel gilt
weighing 10 ounces, a pair of small laten candlesticks, and a
pair of cruets.</p>
<p>Albright Hussey Church having probably long before this fallen
down, Battlefield Church became now, though without any definite
settlement, practically the parish church for the old parish of
Albright Hussey, and it has so continued ever since.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Seal of the College</span>.</h2>
<p>Dukes, in his <i>Antiquities of Shropshire</i>, gives an
engraving of the College Seal.&nbsp; It represents the Blessed
Virgin crowned, the Child in her right hand, in her left a palm
branch.&nbsp; On the dexter side a Shield of Arms, Quarterly
France and England.&nbsp; On the sinister side, a chevron
engrailed between three birds.&nbsp; Over each shield a sword
erect.&nbsp; The legend being,&mdash;&ldquo;S.
Commune-Domini.&nbsp; Rogeri. Ive. primi. magistri. et.
successorum. suorum. Collegii. Beat&aelig;. Mari&aelig;.
Magdalen&aelig;. juxta. Salop.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was probably the
first seal of the College.</p>
<p>Roger Ive, in 1444, complains that it had been fabricated, and
orders a new Seal for the College,&mdash;In the centre, the image
of the Holy Trinity, with the image of S. Mary Magdalene on the
dexter side, and of S. John Baptist on the sinister side, at
their feet the image of Roger Ive kneeling.&nbsp; <a

this second Seal has been preserved.</p>

<p>Roger Ive, of Leaton; rector of Fitz 1399, and of Albright
Hussey 1398 to 1447; first master.</p>
<p>Roger Phillipps, living in 1463, and 1480.</p>

Church in 1503.</p>
<p>John Hussey, 1521.</p>
<p>Humphrey Thomas, 1525 and 1530.</p>
<p>John Hussey, admitted 18 Oct., 1535; aged 40 in 1549; last
master.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Description of the Church</span>.</h2>
<p>Battlefield Church was, as we have seen, doubtless erected in
the years 1407 and 1408, excepting the tower, which was completed
a century later.&nbsp; It is entirely of the perpendicular style
of architecture, with the exception of one window on the north
side of the church and two on the south side which have
reticulated tracery in their heads.&nbsp; The church is not,
strictly speaking, divided into nave and chancel, as is usual in
parish churches, but consists of one covered space only, and is
uniform in its character throughout.</p>
<p>The length of the nave and chancel inside is <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>94 feet, and
of the tower 18 feet; the breadth of the nave is 28 feet, and of
the tower 14 feet; the total length outside being 119 feet, and
the breadth 33 feet.</p>
<p>On the South side of the church was the cemetery or burial
ground, formerly enclosed by a stone wall which came up to the
church, at its south east and south west corners, and had an exit
at the west end.&nbsp; The dimensions of the cemetery are given
in one of the <i>Morris MSS.</i> in the Salop Free Library as
follows,&mdash;length 126 feet, breadth 80 feet, including the
church; from the east end of the church to the ditch, 57 feet;
from north to south between the ditch, 222 feet; width of the
ditch, 22 feet.&nbsp; This stone wall, which was probably coeval
with the church, was taken down at the restoration in 1862.&nbsp;
The church and college originally stood in an oblong space
enclosed by a moat, which may still in places be traced.</p>
<p>The tower is about 100 years later than the rest of the
church, and was completed by Adam Grafton, master of the college,
in 1503.&nbsp; His initials and the date, A.G. 1503, occur on a
shield on the east side of the tower.&nbsp; Roger Ive by his will
in 1444, left directions as to certain alms being accumulated for
the building of the belfry; and the funds may have been thus
raised.&nbsp; The tower has eight pinnacles, which were mostly
replaced in 1862.&nbsp; It is surmounted by an embattled parapet
of equal intervals, with plain cappings.&nbsp; Just below the
battlements, is a handsome carved frieze or border, enriched with
diamond shaped ornaments and quatrefoils.&nbsp; On the west it
has two windows, and one on the east, north, and south
sides.&nbsp; Over the higher of the west windows, in the middle
of the frieze, is an escutcheon bearing an animal, apparently a
lion rampant passant; and over the east window is an escutcheon
having on it the inscription A.G. 1503.&nbsp; <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The second
floor of the tower is furnished with a fireplace, having a
chimney formed within the thickness of the wall, and opening
outside the western window of the bell chamber.&nbsp; Exterior
buttresses are built at the corners of the tower, and a square
projection on its south-east corner has a spiral staircase to the
top.&nbsp; The tower is not placed at right angles to the body of
the church.&nbsp; The break in the stonework at its eastern wall,
the comparative rudeness of the mouldings, the absence of a
second plinth mould to the base, and the coarse treatment of the
angle buttresses at their lower weatherings, all bear out the
statement that the tower is a hundred years later than the body
of the church.</p>
<p>The church was probably all of one pace originally, and no
division made between nave and chancel externally.&nbsp; The
exterior, between the windows, is supported by handsome stone
buttresses.&nbsp; And it seems clear that there never was any
clerestory.</p>
<p>With the exception of the three already referred to, the
windows are all of the perpendicular style, though in some of
them there are evidences of a lingering fondness for the flowing
lines of decorated tracery.&nbsp; Some of the windows have the
dripstones terminating at the bottom with plain returns, others
with representations of human heads.&nbsp; The three windows with
reticulated tracery in their heads, one on the north and two on
the south side, are in style a century earlier than the rest of
the windows.&nbsp; How can they be accounted for?&nbsp; One
theory is that the church was designed by an architect from
France, where the decorated style remained longer than in
England.&nbsp; Another, and more probable, theory is that they
were brought from the neighbouring church of Albright Hussey,
which, judging from the window mouldings in the fragment that
remains, was of 14th century <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>architecture, and was probably
suffered to fall into decay when Battlefield Church was
built.</p>
<p>The east window is of five lights, and has handsome
perpendicular tracery.&nbsp; The present stained glass in it is
modern, and represents our Lord led out to crucifixion, followed
by the women, the home at Bethany, Mary wiping Christ&rsquo;s
feet, the women at the Sepulchre, and the Risen Lord appearing to
Mary,&mdash;all scenes in the history of St. Mary
Magdalene.&nbsp; Above are the Evangelists and four greater
Prophets.&nbsp; The old stained glass represented the decollation
of St. John Baptist, and was probably brought from Albright
Hussey church, which was dedicated to that saint.&nbsp; When the
church was undergoing its first restoration in 1749, this glass
was taken down, and entrusted to the care of a neighbouring
farmer, who suffered his children and servants to destroy it, so
that when it was to be replaced only a few fragments could be
found.&nbsp; These were inserted in the window, much injured and
dilapidated, and contained, amongst other designs, two crowned
heads, a human head in a dish, a chalice and wafer, the
crucifixion, some escutcheons of arms, and an inscription
commencing &ldquo;Orate pro animabus Rogeri . . . hujusce
capellani . . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; These fragments at the
second restoration in 1862 were carried away to Prees Church, and
some portions to the ante-chapel at Sundorne Castle.</p>
<p>The stained glass in the vestry, not of any high artistic
merit, was not originally in the church, but was brought from
France by the Rev. A. J. Pigott, and placed in the vestry.</p>
<p>Outside the church, immediately over the East window, is a
niche, surmounted by a canopy, in which stands the statue of
Henry IV., about half life-size, crowned, with a dagger hanging
on his left side, and his right hand grasping a sword.</p>
<p>On each side of the exterior of the chancel, near <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the East end,
are dripstones, as if intended for the arch of a window, carried
up nearly to a point.&nbsp; No window ever was thrown out in
either place; and probably the architect&rsquo;s intention may
have been to add small side chapels at some future time.</p>
<p>At the dissolution of the college, two great bells and a
sanctus bell were left.&nbsp; These bells are traditionally said
to have been carried off to Berrington or Wroxeter in the last
century.&nbsp; In 1861 the only bell went to St. Mary&rsquo;s,
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The present bell is modern, and was cast by
Naylor, Vickers and Co. in 1861.</p>
<p>The three sedilia with plain gothic arches, and the piscina
adjoining, on the south side of the altar, are original.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"Our Lady of Pity with the dead Christ in her lap"

"Our Lady of Pity with the dead Christ in her lap"
 src="images/p20s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the chancel is a seated figure of &ldquo;Our Lady <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of
Pity,&rdquo; the blessed Virgin with the dead Christ in her
lap.&nbsp; This is said to have been brought here from Albright
Hussey.&nbsp; It is 3ft. 9in. high, and carved out of a block of
oak hollowed behind.&nbsp; The execution of the image is good,
and it is probably of 14th century work.&nbsp; It was formerly
seated in the westernmost of the three sedilia.&nbsp; There was
formerly another figure, that of a man, in one of the other
sedilia, but it was destroyed at the first restoration of
1749.</p>
<p>Some fragments of the original roof still remain, worked up
into the present chancel roof.&nbsp; The corbels at the spring of
the roof trusses, some of foliage, but mostly of heads, are
original and are well carved.&nbsp; Outside are a few of the
original gurgoyles, though most were placed there in 1861.</p>
<p>The nave is entered by a doorway under the tower, which was
reopened out in 1861.&nbsp; There are also doors on the north and
south sides of the nave, the latter formerly leading into the
cemetery; and on the north and south sides of the chancel, the
former leading into the vestry, the latter, which formerly
communicated with a priest&rsquo;s chamber, being now bricked up
and the organ placed over it.</p>
<p>Above the south chancel doorway, over the organ, nearly up to
the roof, is a small square aperture now bricked up, which
communicated with an outer priest&rsquo;s chamber, and enabled
its occupants to see inside the church.&nbsp; On the south side
of the church, near the second bay from the eastern end, between
the second and third buttresses may be seen some masonry, the
foundations of a building which was three storeys in height, the
upper storeys being approached by a circular staircase, of which
the foundations still remain.&nbsp; The lowest storey opened
directly into the church by the doorway now bricked up.&nbsp;
From the upmost storey the little square window opened into the
church.&nbsp; On the buttresses may be seen some <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>projecting
pieces of masonry, which supported the topmost storey; over the
doorway may be seen against the wall a projecting support for the
middle storey.&nbsp; These little rooms were probably only about
9ft. square, and were for the accommodation of the priests whilst
on duty at the church.</p>
<p>A modern screen divides the choir from the nave.&nbsp; Round
the church are fixed a number of shields bearing the arms of
those knights and others who fell in the battle.</p>
<p>The font is modern, though a portion of the ancient font was
lying in the tower in the year 1856, and a second font was
erected in 1749 probably and taken away in 1861.</p>
<p>The vestry, or strictly speaking the Corbet mortuary chapel,
was erected in 1861 over the place of interment of the family of
Corbet of Sundorne Castle and Pimley.&nbsp; The Corbets are the
patrons and proprietors of Battlefield.</p>
<p>On the north side of the chancel is a large and handsome
monument erected in December 1821, to the memory of John Corbet,
Esq., and several members of his family.&nbsp; John Corbet died
19 May 1817, aged 65 years; Emma Elizabeth, his first wife, and
daughter of Sir Charlton Leighton, Bart., died 19 September,
1797; Annabella, wife of Sir Theodore Henry Lavington Brinckman,
Baronet, and daughter of John Corbet, Esq., died 24th January,
1864, aged 61.&nbsp; Several other of this family are also named
on this monument, and lie buried in the vault, which was made in
August 1797.</p>
<p>A brass, mounted on jasper, affixed to the south wall of the
tower, commemorates the restoration of 1861.&nbsp; It bears this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;This church, dedicated to St. Mary
Magdalene, was built and endowed by Henry IV. in memory of the
battle of Shrewsbury 1403.&nbsp; Having fallen into decay, its
restoration, originated by public subscription, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>was finally
completed in the year of Our Lord 1861, at the private cost of
Annabella, wife of Sir Theodore Brinckman, Bart., according to
plans prepared by Pountney Smith, Architect.&nbsp; Soli Deo
Gloria.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Restorations of</span> 1749 <span
class="smcap">and</span> 1861.</h2>
<p>Battlefield Church has twice been restored, first about the
year 1749, at whose expense we do not know, and again in 1861 at
the cost of Lady Brinckman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>I fix upon 1749 as the approximate date of the first
restoration for several reasons.&nbsp; The Parish Register that
year speaks of &ldquo;the church then down,&rdquo; Mr. Leonard
Hotchkiss being the minister.&nbsp; In 1746 &ldquo;briefs&rdquo;
were being collected for the church.&nbsp; The earliest known
engraving, after a sketch by James Bowen, of the north side of
the church, which cannot have been engraved later than 1769, as
Mr. Percy (afterwards Bishop of Dromore), had a copy that year,
represents the church as then being in a perfect state
externally, and states &ldquo;this church was rebuilt a few years
since.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i> for 1803 states
that &ldquo;the church was repaired and altered about 50 or 60
years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this points to 1749 as the date.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Probably little had been done to the church from the time of
the dissolution of the college down to 1749, and it had been
allowed to fall into a bad state.&nbsp; The Puritans, too, during
the commonwealth are said to have damaged it.&nbsp; At all
events, about 1749 some considerable reparations were
effected.&nbsp; The church was probably newly roofed, though
still kept all of one pace, and somewhat lowered.&nbsp; The
buttresses were surmounted by heads or gurgoyles.&nbsp; The roof,
too, was plastered and whitewashed.&nbsp; The stained glass was
removed from the east window, and, being carelessly kept, was
much broken, and only some fragments re-inserted.&nbsp; The old
font was taken away, and a <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>new one placed in the church.&nbsp;
The tower was bound together with iron bars, nuts, and
screws.&nbsp; The parapets, if there were any round the church,
and most of the pinnacles and gurgoyles were taken down.&nbsp; A
new bell was placed in the tower, which seems to have borne the
inscription, &ldquo;Ab. Rudhall of Gloucester cast me,
1755.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must feel thankful that the
&ldquo;restoration&rdquo; was not carried to greater lengths and
that the walls and tower were spared.</p>
<p>The work done about 1749 was not of a permanent nature.&nbsp;
In a few years&rsquo; time the roof of the nave portion of the
building must have fallen in, and no attempt was made to replace
it.&nbsp; Fearing that the roof of the chancel portion might also
give way, four ugly circular Doric pillars on pedestals were
introduced to support it; and a brick wall was built at the west
end of the chancel, separating it from the nave.&nbsp; From this
time, and until 1861, the chancel only was used for divine
service.&nbsp; The nave was suffered to fall into complete
decay.&nbsp; The buttresses of the chancel were a little
shortened, and the gurgoyles removed.</p>
<p>When the roof of the nave fell in we do not know, but
certainly before 1792.&nbsp; In 1810, the nave and steeple were
ruinous, though &ldquo;the whole was entire within the memory of
persons now living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November, 1855, the late Mr. S. Pountney Smith, of
Shrewsbury, made a set of plans for the restoration of the
church, though the work was not finally accomplished until the
year 1861.&nbsp; The expense of the work, amounting to
&pound;4,000, was borne by Lady Brinckman.&nbsp; It took twelve
months to carry out.&nbsp; The tower was completely renovated,
the nave repaired, the new columns in the chancel taken away, and
the whole new-roofed, and put into a thorough state of
repair.&nbsp; A new parapet was placed round the nave and
chancel, that on the nave being plain, whilst the chancel <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>parapet was
pierced with quatrefoils, and enriched with pinnacles.&nbsp; A
new vestry, or Corbet mortuary chapel was built on the north side
of the chancel.&nbsp; The church was re-opened on Friday,
November 1st, All Saints&rsquo; Day, 1861, the preacher being the
Bishop of Oxford.</p>
<p>The new work was on the whole, when we consider the
dilapidated state of the church, thoroughly well carried
out.&nbsp; Perhaps the chief defect is the marked distinction
made between nave and chancel, which is unusual in Collegiate
Churches, and in this church never existed.&nbsp; It would have
been better if both had been kept of the same pace, and had been
decorated and finished alike.&nbsp; It seems to have been a
mistake, too, to pull down the cemetery wall on the south side of
the church, which had existed ever since its first erection.</p>
<p>The Vicarage House was built about 1862, at some little
distance west from the church.&nbsp; The site of the old college
has never yet been ascertained; it may have stood on the east
side of the church; and it is not known when it was taken
down.&nbsp; Nor is it known where the almshouse or hospital for
poor men stood, nor how long it lasted, nor when it was
destroyed.&nbsp; Both probably did not remain long after the
dissolution of the chantry.</p>
<p>The church is distant three miles from Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
Proceeding down the Hadnall Road, it comes into sight directly
after passing the Old Heath Farm (Mr. John Randles) on the
left-hand side, and looks most picturesque with its handsome
tower flanked by the woods on its north side.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
